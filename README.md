This project is a Netflix clone built using React.js for the front end, Firebase for authentication and database functionalities, and React Toastify for elegant notifications.
  Here I have tried to use my prerequestive knowledge of react.js and tried to explore firebase.


Features and Technologies Used:
React.js:

Component-Based Architecture: The application is structured using reusable React components.
React Hooks: Utilizes useState, useEffect, and useRef hooks for state management and lifecycle methods.
Firebase:

Firestore Database: Firebase Firestore is used as the database to store user-specific data like favorite movies, watch lists, etc.

React Toastify:

Notifications: Used for displaying notifications to users, such as success messages on signing in or error messages on failed operations, providing a better user experience.
